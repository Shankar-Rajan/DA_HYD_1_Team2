## **Deployment**

### **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):**

To maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure smooth deployments for the E-Asset Management System, we've integrated a CI/CD pipeline. This automated process guarantees that every feature, fix, or enhancement in our asset management tool is thoroughly vetted before reaching our users.

### **Vercel Deployment (Frontend):**

The E-Asset Management System's front-end provides users and admins with a visual interface to interact with assets and is seamlessly deployed using Vercel.

By adopting Vercel for our frontend deployments, we ensure that the E-Asset Management System remains accessible, efficient, and up-to-date as a reliable tool for all asset management needs.

## **Further Improvements**

4. **Multilingual Support**:
    
    Add support for multiple languages, ensuring the platform can cater to a global audience and be accessible to non-English speakers.
    
5. **Cloud Integration**:
    
    To handle growing data and user access needs, migrate databases and servers to cloud platforms, ensuring scalability and enhanced performance.
    

## **Project Dashboard Overview**

Our project dashboard on GitHub is a central hub to monitor and manage various aspects of our project:

1. **Issues**:
    
    * **Overview**: We used issues to track various elements, from enhancements and tasks to the diverse questions that arose during the project.
        
    * **Assigned**: We designated specific team members for each issue, ensuring clarity in roles and responsibilities.
        
2. **Pull Requests**:
    
    * **Overview**: We utilized pull requests to communicate the changes we pushed to branches in our repository, facilitating collaborative code reviews and integrations.
        
    * **Linked Issues**: When a pull request addresses a particular issue, we connect them for coherent tracking.
        
    * **Reviewers**: We assigned one reviewer to each pull request. The individual was responsible for examining the changes and providing essential feedback to ensure our code met the necessary quality standards before merging.
        
3. **Task Status**: We visualized our task progress using a Kanban-style board. This board showed tasks in various phases, such as "To do," "In progress," and "Done."
    
4. **Date Completed**: As we resolved task issues or merged pull requests, we timestamped them, giving us a detailed timeline of our project milestones.
    
5. **Assignees**: Team members were consistently assigned to tasks, issues, or pull requests. This process ensured everyone was clear on their responsibilities.
    
6. **Repository Link**: For reference, we provided a direct link to our central repository, which housed all the code, assets, and the comprehensive version history.
